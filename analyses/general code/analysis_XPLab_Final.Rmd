Load the required packages 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(rstan)
# set cores to use to the total number of cores (minimally 4)
options(mc.cores = max(parallel::detectCores(), 4))
# save a compiled version of the Stan model file
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)

set.seed(123)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
