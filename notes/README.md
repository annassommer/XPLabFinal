## Folder containing notes from all relevant discussions and meetings


### Discussion with Noa - 13.06.2019  

+ *Main take-away*: Changed the experiment to replication of only study 4 to the replication of study 1 & 4a
+ *Experiment design*:  
  1) Rate personality traits for their human-likeness  
  2) Ask participants if the face is dominant or if the face is trustworthy (coin-flip)

+ *Assumption*: "Inverted face are less human-like"  

1) Tests how strong dominance and trustworthiness are linked to human-likeness  
2) Rate the trustworthiness or the dominance of the face  


**Hypothesis**: "Inverted faces are more likely to be rated as being dominant than upright faces."  

+ Experiment will be in German  
  Problem of 2 languages:  
    - if the results are very different, the smaller group has to be rejected
    - native language of most participants (less likely to associate human-likeness with foreign words)  

+ Preregistration has to sent in: beginning of experiment
